# Income Plan API Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Income Plan APIs into the React application, replacing the mock localStorage-based salary management system with real API calls.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. API Configuration Updated
- **File**: `src/api/config.ts`
- **Changes**: Added INCOME_PLANS endpoints configuration
- **Endpoints Added**:
  - `/income-plans` (base)
  - `/income-plans/{id}` (by ID)
  - `/income-plans/{planId}/sources` (sources)
  - `/income-plans/{planId}/sources/{sourceId}` (source by ID)
  - `/income-plans/{planId}/sources/{sourceId}/entries` (entries)
  - `/income-plans/{planId}/milestones` (milestones)
  - `/income-plans/{planId}/milestones/{milestoneId}` (milestone by ID)

### 2. SalaryManagement Component Refactored
- **File**: `src/pages/SalaryManagement.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced `useSalary` hook with `useIncomePlans` hook
  - Updated form data structure to match Income Plan API requirements
  - Changed frequency options to match `IncomeFrequency` enum (WEEKLY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, YEARLY)
  - Updated form submission to create/update Income Plans instead of Salary Plans
  - Modified display section to show Income Plan data (target amount, current progress, status)
  - **Savings Goals Integration**: Replaced local state savings goals with Income Plan Milestones API
  - Added localStorage cleanup to remove old `mock_salary_plans` data
  - Implemented milestone management for savings goals using:
    - `POST /api/income-plans/{planId}/milestones` (Add milestone)
    - `GET /api/income-plans/{planId}/milestones` (Fetch milestones)
    - `DELETE /api/income-plans/{planId}/milestones/{milestoneId}` (Delete milestone)

### 3. Enhanced useIncomePlans Hook
- **File**: `src/hooks/useIncomePlans.ts`
- **Changes**: Added helper methods for backward compatibility:
  - `getActiveIncomePlan()`: Returns the active income plan
  - `getMonthlyIncome()`: Calculates monthly income from target amount
  - `getNextPayDate()`: Returns estimated next pay date
  - `calculateTotalExpectedIncome()`: Calculates total expected income from sources

### 4. Updated Dashboard Component
- **File**: `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- **Changes**: Replaced `useSalary` hook with `useIncomePlans` hook

### 5. Updated InvestmentSuggestions Component
- **File**: `src/pages/InvestmentSuggestions.tsx`
- **Changes**: Replaced `useSalary` hook with `useIncomePlans` hook

### 6. localStorage Cleanup
- Removed `mock_salary_plans` localStorage data automatically when the SalaryManagement component loads
- This ensures no conflicts between old mock data and new API data

## API Integration Details

### Create Income Plan
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/income-plans`
- **Mapping**: Form data (employer, salary, frequency) â†’ Income Plan (name, description, targetAmount)
- **Target Amount**: Calculated as annual income (monthly equivalent Ã— 12)

### Get Income Plans
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/income-plans`
- **Usage**: Loads all user's income plans and identifies the active one

### Update Income Plan
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/income-plans/{id}`
- **Mapping**: Similar to create, updates existing plan structure

### Savings Goals as Milestones
- **Add Goal**: `POST /api/income-plans/{planId}/milestones`
  - Maps form fields (name, targetAmount, targetDate, priority) to milestone structure
  - Priority becomes part of the description field
- **Get Goals**: `GET /api/income-plans/{planId}/milestones`
  - Loads milestones for the active income plan
  - Displays as savings goals in the UI
- **Delete Goal**: `DELETE /api/income-plans/{planId}/milestones/{milestoneId}`
  - Removes milestone/savings goal from the plan

## Data Structure Changes

### Before (Salary Plan + Local Savings Goals)
```typescript
interface SalaryPlan {
  id: string;
  employer: string;
  expectedNetSalary: number;
  payCycle: PayCycle;
  payDay: number;
  currency: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}

interface SavingsGoal {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  targetAmount: number;
  currentAmount: number;
  targetDate: string;
  priority: "high" | "medium" | "low";
}
```

### After (Income Plan + Milestones as Goals)
```typescript
interface IncomePlan {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  targetAmount: number;
  currentAmount: number;
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  userId: string;
}

interface IncomePlanMilestone {
  id: string;
  incomePlanId: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  targetAmount: number;
  targetDate: string;
  isCompleted: boolean;
  completedDate?: string | null;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

## TODO Items for Future Enhancement

1. **Create Income Sources**: When an income plan is created, add corresponding income sources for salary details
2. **Load Income Sources**: Display actual income sources from the plan instead of form data
3. **Update Income Entries**: Allow recording actual salary receipts as income entries
4. **Enhanced Pay Date Calculation**: Use income source frequency data for accurate next pay date calculation
5. **Multi-Source Support**: Support multiple income sources per plan (salary + freelance + investments)
6. **Progress Tracking**: Enhance milestone progress tracking to show actual vs target amounts

## Testing Status
- âœ… TypeScript compilation successful
- âœ… Build process successful
- âœ… No lint errors
- âœ… localStorage cleanup implemented
- âœ… Backward compatibility maintained for Dashboard and Investment components
- âœ… Savings goals implemented as Income Plan Milestones
- âœ… Milestone API integration (Create, Read, Delete) working

## Implementation Summary

### ðŸ“‹ **What happens on Save Changes:**

1. Form validates employer name and base salary
2. Calculates annual target amount (monthly income Ã— 12)
3. Creates/updates Income Plan via API call
4. No data stored to localStorage anymore
5. Success toast notification shown
6. **Savings goals are now managed as milestones** attached to the income plan

### ðŸŽ¯ **Savings Goals Implementation:**

- **Add Goal**: Creates a new milestone with title, description (includes priority), target amount, and target date
- **Display Goals**: Shows milestones as savings goals with completion status
- **Delete Goal**: Removes milestone from the income plan
- **Progress Tracking**: Currently shows 0% (can be enhanced to track actual progress)

## Notes
The integration maintains backward compatibility while providing a foundation for more advanced income tracking features. Savings goals are now properly managed as Income Plan Milestones using the provided APIs, completely removing localStorage dependency for both income plans and savings goals.
